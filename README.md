# Personal-Website-Unit1
 Techdegree Project 1

 This is my first project from TreeHouse for the Web Design Techdegree. It is a personal website showing the use of HTML and CSS. 

 Features shown include:
 HTML features such as links, images, semantic code, and organization.
 CSS features such as the use of colors, text styles, animation/transformation, and specific class features for images and headers.

Content includes pages for my resume, photos(art and cats), contact page, and a biography on the home page. It is a simple set up.
